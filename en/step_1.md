## What you will do

Connect a Raspberry Pi Pico to another computer and learn how to program it using MicroPython to blink the onboard LED. If you have additional components available, then you can also try out some more examples.

A Raspberry Pi Pico has GPIO pins, much like a Raspberry Pi computer, which means it can be used to control and receive input from a variety of electronic devices.
