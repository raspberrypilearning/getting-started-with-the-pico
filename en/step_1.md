## Introduction

In this project, you will connect up a Raspberry Pi Pico to another computer and learn how to program it using MicroPython.

A Raspberry Pi Pico is a low-cost microcontroller device. Microcontrollers are tiny computers, but they tend to lack large volume storage and peripheral devices that you can plug in (for example, keyboards or monitors).

A Raspberry Pi Pico has GPIO pins, much like a Raspberry Pi computer, which means it can be used to control and receive input from a variety of electronic devices.

### What you will make

You will connect a Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer, install the Thonny Python IDE, and write a MicroPython program to blink the onboard LED. If you have additional components available, then you can also try out some more examples.
