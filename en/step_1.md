## Introduction

In this project, you will connect up a Raspberry Pi Pico to another computer and learn how to program it using MicroPython.

The Raspberry Pi Pico is a low cost microcontroller device. Microcontrollers are tiny computers, but they tend to lack things like large volume storage and peripheral decices that you can plug in, like keyboards or monitors.

The Raspberry Pi Pico has GPIO pins, much like the Raspberry Pi Computer, which means it can be used to control and receive input from a variety of electronic devices.

### What you will make

You will connect a Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer, install the Thonny Python editor and write a MicroPython program to blink the onboard LED. If you have additional components available then you can also try out some more examples.
