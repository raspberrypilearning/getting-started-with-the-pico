## Run headless

If you want to run your Raspberry Pi Pico without it being attached to your computer, you need to use a USB power supply.

To automatically run a MicroPython program when the Pico powers up, you can save it to the Pico with the name `main.py`

--- task ---

In Thonny, click on the **File** menu and then **Save as** for the last program you wrote.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

When prompted, select 'Raspberry Pi Pico' from the pop-up menu.

--- /task ---

**Debug**: If you get an error saying the device is busy, you need to first 'Stop' ðŸ›‘ the program running on the Pico.

--- task ---

Name your file `main.py`

--- /task ---

--- task ---

You can now disconnect your Raspberry Pi Pico from your computer and use a micro USB cable to connect it to a mobile power source, such as a power bank.

Safe operating voltages are between 1.8V and 5.5V.

--- /task ---

Once connected, the `main.py` file should run automatically.

If you want to make your own power bank, then follow this guide.
