In this step you will run some simple Python code on your Raspberry Pi Pico using the Thonny Shell.

Make sure that your Raspberry Pi Pico is connected to your computer and you have the MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico) interpreter selected.

Look at the 'Shell' panel at the bottom of the Thonny editor.

Thonny will now be able to communicate with the Raspberry Pi Pico using the REPL (read–eval–print loop) which allows you to type in Python code into the Shell and see the output.
