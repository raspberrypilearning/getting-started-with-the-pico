## Control an LED with an analogue input

Your Raspberry Pi Pico has input pins that can receive analogue signals. This means that instead of only reading the values of `1` and `0` (on and off), it can read values in between.

A potentiometer is the perfect analogue device for this activity.

Replace the button in your circuit with a potentiometer. Follow the wiring diagram below to connect it to GPIO pin 26.
