<mark>We may not need this step if Thonny is updated to offer to do it automatically. Or we may wish to cover it in a step after Thonny about working with the Pico from the command line and transferring programs directly. See [github discussion](https://github.com/raspberrypi/thonny-pico/issues/1)</mark>
