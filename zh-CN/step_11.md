## What next?

- Try the new [Introduction to Raspberry Pi Pico path](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/pico-intro), using the picozero package, to control LEDs and buzzers and read signals from switches and dials.

- Why not try out a few more components with your Raspberry Pi Pico â€” perhaps a buzzer, a light-dependent resistor (LDR), or even a motor controller

- For further guidance on using your Raspberry Pi Pico, you can have a look at the [documentation here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/)
